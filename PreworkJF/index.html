      Welcome to my page! I am excited to be a part of the Per Scholas Software
      Engineering program and I am ready and focused on my goal of becoming a
      full stack software developer. I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology from
      the University of Cincinnati although I have never been employed within
      that field. My post college career experiece spans from working in
      Investment Management and Title & Escrow to University Accreditation and
      Construction Adminisration. I look forward to the day when I have the
      skills and experience required to be able to build custom solutions for
      the many unique business challenges faced by some of the organizations and
      industries I have worked with in the past. See my list below for a few
      personal details about me and complete the form at the end of this page if
      you would like to get in touch with me directly . I am thrilled to have
      this opportunity with Per Scholas.
