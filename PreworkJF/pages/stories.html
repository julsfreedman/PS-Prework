    <h3>Now, This is a Story</h3>
    <p>
      ...all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And I'd like to
      take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince
      of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia born and raised On the
      playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin',
      relaxin', all cool And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When
      a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my
      neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said,
      "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air" I begged and pleaded
      with her day after day But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
      She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket I put my Walkman on and
      said, "I might as well kick it" First class, yo this is bad Drinking
      orange juice out of a champagne glass Is this what the people of Bel-Air
      living like? Hmm, this might be alright But wait, I hear they're prissy,
      bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this
      cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're
      prepared for the prince of Bel-Air Well, the plane landed and when I came
      out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
      I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the
      quickness like lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it
      came near The license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If
      anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it,
      yo, holmes to Bel Air" I pulled up to the house about seven or eight And I
      yelled to the cabbie, "Yo holmes, smell ya later" I looked at my kingdom I
      was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air. &copy;

    <h3>Now Here's a Little Story</h3>
    <p>
      ...I've got to tell About three bad brothers you know so well It started
      way back in history With Ad-Rock, MCA, (and me) Mike D Been had a little
      horsey named Paul Revere Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer Riding
      across the land, kicking up sand Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm
      in demand One lonely Beastie I be All by myself without nobody The sun is
      beating down on my baseball hat The air is getting hot, the beer is
      getting flat Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy His name was MCA, I
      said, "Howdy," he said, "Hi" He told a little story that sounded
      well-rehearsed Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst The brew
      was in my hand, and he was on my tip His voice was hoarse, his throat was
      dry, he asked me for a sip He said, "Can I get some?", I said, "You can't
      get none!" Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun Quick on the draw,
      I thought I'd be dead He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
      "Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (yeah) I think you know
      what time it is, it's time to get ill (yeah) Now what do we have here, an
      outlaw and his beer? (uh huh) I run this land, you understand? I've made
      myself clear?" We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin You
      think this story's over, but it's ready to begin...&copy;
